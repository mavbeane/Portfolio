					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<img src="assets/images/pups.jpg" alt="Two brown dogs sitting on a green couch" width="200" height="200" class="about-image">
					<p>I grew up on the property of a historical amusement park in the suburbs outside of New York City. After attending college in Upstate New York, I moved to Arizona, back to New York, and finally landed in Austin in 2010.</p>
					<p>In 2014, I completed my Master of Fine Arts in Communication Design at Texas State. My thesis research focused on using interactive design to teach digital native undergraduate students typography. I love being an educator as much as I love learning. As a design thinker, I enjoy working through the conceptual, creative, and technical steps of each project.
					Currently, I am designer for a NYC based startup, focusing mostly on UX/UI and front-end web development.</p>
					<p>My husband and I live in South Austin with our two dogs, Brooklyn and Luna, and we are expecting our first Little Beane in February.</p>
